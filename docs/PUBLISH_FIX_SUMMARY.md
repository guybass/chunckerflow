# Publish Script Fixes - Summary

## Issues Found

When running `publish.bat`, you encountered:

1. **Wrong working directory** - Script ran from `C:\` instead of project directory
2. **clean_notebooks.py not found** - Path issue due to wrong directory
3. **pytest not installed** - Tests failed because pytest wasn't available

## ‚úÖ Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Working Directory Issue

**Added to `publish.bat`:**
```batch
REM Change to the directory where this script is located
cd /d "%~dp0"
```

Now the script always runs from its own directory, regardless of where you execute it from.

### 2. Made Tests Optional

**Updated test step in `publish.bat`:**
- Checks if `pytest` is available before running tests
- If pytest not found: Skips tests with a note about GitHub Actions
- If pytest found but tests fail: Asks if you want to continue anyway

### 3. Created Quick Publish Script (Recommended)

**New file: `publish_quick.bat`**

This is the **recommended script** for your workflow:
- Skips local tests completely
- Relies on GitHub Actions to run tests on push to main
- Faster local publishing
- No pytest installation required

## üìù Publishing Options

You now have **3 options** for publishing:

### Option 1: Quick Publish (Recommended) ‚≠ê

```cmd
publish_quick.bat
```

**What it does:**
- ‚úÖ Cleans build artifacts
- ‚úÖ Cleans Jupyter notebooks
- ‚úÖ Builds distribution packages
- ‚úÖ Validates packages
- ‚úÖ Uploads to PyPI
- ‚ùå Skips local tests (uses GitHub Actions instead)

**Use when:**
- You want fast publishing
- You trust GitHub Actions for testing
- You don't have pytest installed locally

### Option 2: Full Validation

```cmd
publish.bat
```

**What it does:**
- ‚úÖ Everything from Option 1
- ‚úÖ Runs tests locally (if pytest available)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Warns if tests fail, asks to continue

**Use when:**
- You want to run tests locally before publishing
- You have pytest installed

### Option 3: Manual Step-by-Step

```cmd
REM Clean
if exist build rmdir /s /q build
if exist dist rmdir /s /q dist

REM Build
python -m build

REM Validate
twine check dist/*

REM Upload
twine upload dist/*
```

**Use when:**
- You want full control
- Debugging issues

## üöÄ GitHub Actions Testing

Your repository already has GitHub Actions configured to run tests automatically:

**File:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

**Runs on:**
- Every push to `main` branch
- Every pull request to `main` branch

**What it tests:**
- ‚úÖ Code quality (Black, isort, Ruff, mypy)
- ‚úÖ Tests on Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12
- ‚úÖ Tests on Linux, macOS, Windows
- ‚úÖ Security scans (Bandit, Safety)
- ‚úÖ Docker build

So you can safely skip local tests and let GitHub Actions handle it!

## üìã Updated Workflow

### Recommended Workflow

1. **Make your changes**
   ```cmd
   REM Edit code, update version, update CHANGELOG.md
   ```

2. **Commit and push to GitHub**
   ```cmd
   git add .
   git commit -m "chore: prepare release v0.1.0"
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Wait for GitHub Actions to pass** ‚úÖ
   - Check: https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/chunk-flow/actions
   - All tests must pass before publishing

4. **Publish to PyPI**
   ```cmd
   publish_quick.bat
   ```

5. **Create git tag and GitHub release**
   ```cmd
   git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "Release v0.1.0"
   git push origin v0.1.0
   ```

6. **Create GitHub release**
   - Go to: https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/chunk-flow/releases/new
   - Select tag v0.1.0
   - Upload dist files
   - Publish

## üõ†Ô∏è Files Updated

1. **`publish.bat`** - Fixed directory issue, made tests optional
2. **`publish_quick.bat`** - NEW: Quick publish without local tests
3. **`QUICK_PUBLISH.txt`** - Updated with 3 options
4. **`PUBLISH_FIX_SUMMARY.md`** - This file

## ‚úÖ Testing the Fix

Try running the script again:

```cmd
cd "C:\Users\Lenovo i7\Desktop\my_personal_projects\chunckerflow"
publish_quick.bat
```

Expected output:
```
===================================
ChunkFlow Quick Publish Script
===================================

Working directory: C:\Users\Lenovo i7\Desktop\my_personal_projects\chunckerflow

NOTE: This script skips local tests.
Tests will run automatically on GitHub Actions when you push to main.

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Always push to GitHub first** before publishing
   - This triggers tests on GitHub Actions
   - Verify all tests pass before publishing to PyPI

2. **Use `publish_quick.bat` for normal releases**
   - Faster workflow
   - GitHub Actions provides comprehensive testing
   - No need for local pytest installation

3. **Check GitHub Actions status**
   - Visit: https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/chunk-flow/actions
   - Make sure the latest push shows all green ‚úÖ

4. **Version already exists error?**
   - You cannot re-upload the same version to PyPI
   - Increment version in `__init__.py` and `pyproject.toml`
   - Rebuild and upload again

## üéØ Ready to Publish?

```cmd
REM 1. Ensure everything is committed and pushed
git status
git push origin main

REM 2. Wait for GitHub Actions to pass (check on GitHub)

REM 3. Run quick publish script
publish_quick.bat

REM 4. Follow the prompts and enter your PyPI token

REM 5. Create tag and release
git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "Release v0.1.0"
git push origin v0.1.0
```

**All fixed and ready to go!** üöÄ
